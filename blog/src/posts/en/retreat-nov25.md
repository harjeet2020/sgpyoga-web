Dear Family,

This November, yoga and spirituality is coming to Colombia - specifically to *Salento, Quindío*. The purpose of this 4-day immersion is to provide you with a space to heal, transform, and rejuvenate. The very definition of a retreat is to take a step back - a step back from the constant pressure imposed upon us by the demands of the modern world. This is your chance to take some time for yourself, reconnect with the essence of your soul, and regain a sense of inner peace and harmony.

This partricular retreat will be a mixture of different practices and activities. We will practice Kundalini and Vinyasa Yoga, try meditation and sound therapy, study spiritual teachings such as yogic philosophy or mayan calendar, explore our creativity through traditional weaving and shamanic dance, and connect with the community through evening sharing circles. We will also explore nature through short hikes to mountains, lakes and waterfalls - you will find that *Salento* has a lot to offer in that regard. And optionally (at an additional cost), you can extend the retreat by one day more for a trip to famous *Valle de Cócora*.

The retreat will take place from November 14 to November 17, 2025. You can arrive as early as the 13th, and leave either on the 18th or, if you opt in for the *Valle de Cócora* trip, on the 19th in the morning. Hope to see you there!

With Love,
