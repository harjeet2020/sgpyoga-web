To us, owning a yoga school isn't only about business - it is about family. In this article, we would like to introduce ourselves to you, so that you can get to know us better and feel at home in our community.

My name is Harjeet, and I am the founder of SGP Yoga. At least, I was the one who opened the company and invented the name - Camila did all the hard work of creating the community that we have today. My journey with yoga started in 2018, when I was 19 years old. At this stage of my life I felt lost and confused; I did't particuarly enjoy living, and was accompanied by constant depression and anxiety. At one point, I realized I simply couldn't go on like this. I made many radical changes in my life, including quitting university before obtaining my computer science degree, and I started to look for answers in spiritual philosophy and yoga. I went all in, attending spiritual workshops and practicing yoga for many hours each day, because I so desperately needed healing & transformation. And it simply just... worked.

I felt Light enter my experience of life in overwhelming waves, and for the first time ever I felt truly alive. Over the course of a few years I became a totally different person, overcoming many negative aspects of my personality I was previously unaware of. I understood that the original cause of my suffering was not the external world but my very own self, and my entire approach to life changed to reflect this understanding. After one year of intense spiritual practice, I already started to teach - firstly to family and friends, then slowly open classes to others. After the pandemic was over I finally obtaiend my KRI Level 1 200-Hour Kundalini Yoga certification, and was determined to start teaching professionally.

From there, it was a long journey. Despite my determination to teach, for many years I had to work other jobs in order to make ends meet. I worked as an English teacher, video editor, and even a paid intern software engineer. I never stopped teaching though, and I got to experience the joy of seeing my students grow and transform. I also had the opportunity to travel the world, moving from Poland to Cambodia, and then to Mexico where I live today. Then, I met Camila - and the rest is history.
