To us, owning a yoga school isn't only about business - it is about family. In this article, we would like to introduce ourselves to you, so that you can get to know us better and feel at home in our community.

## Harjeet
I am the founder of SGP Yoga and a KRI-certified kundalini yoga teacher. My joruney with kundalini started back in 2018 in my home country, Poland, when I was but 19 years old. The practice has helped me immensely in my spiritual growth, totally transforming my personality and experience of life. Since then I have spent many years travelling and sharing my knowledge in various forms.

Besides kundalini yoga I also specialize in teaching modern spiritual philosophy - a practice that encourages everybody to seek truth about the universe within their own heart. My mission is helping people heal and find inner peace, in any form that works for them. I am also a writer, a music composer & producer, and a software engineer - or at least, these are the things I do for fun!

## Camila
I am a co-founder of SGP Yoga, a professional dancer of the contemporary genre, and besides that, a certified vinyasa & aerial yoga teacher. I come from Colombia, but I have been living in Mexico for many years now. I specialize in advanced body alignment techniques - I have helped many of my students enter postures they had thought impossible. In my career as a teacher I have found that I particualrly enjoy working with women, helping them find their inner strength and overcome their limitations.

Besides my work as a yoga teacher, my passion is art as therapy. I create contemporary dance performances that explore the depths of the human experience, and share them with the world through visits to local communities. I have received many awards and scholarships for my dance-related work, and this is what allowed me to grow so much as an artist and start performing in front of real audiences.

## Dani
Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the world of dance, theater, and martial arts. With time, my passion for movement and body expression has become my profession. I have studied contemporary dance for 4 years now, which has allowed me to achieve an extraordinary level of control over my body. I have complemented my dance training with pilates and aerial yoga teacher certifications - and this blend of skills has allowed me to develop a unique style of teaching that is capable of challenging even yoga veterans. I am deeply passionate about teaching; in my classes, I help people develop a deeper connection with their body, combining pure joy of movement and the transformational power of yoga into an extremely fun and engaging experience.

## Aro
I am a graphic designer and a hatha & aerial yoga teacher. As of now, I have completed a 200-hour hatha yoga and 100-hour aerial yoga certification - and am planning to add ashtanga yoga to my repertoire in the near future. I don't limit myself to a single yoga style - I love to explore different takes on yoga to constantly enrich my practice with new techniques and reach new heights of personal growth.

My joruney hasn't been easy - I've had to face many challenges in my life, but yoga has always been there to help me through it. I am grateful for every part of this process, as it has helped me grow as a person and as a teacher. To me, yoga is far more than just a physical practice, it is a way of life - and this is what I try to share with my students.

## Itzel
By profession, I am a psychologist - but I have found fulfillment as a yoga teacher. The practice has come into my life during the pandemic, in a moment of great stress and uncertainty. It has helped me through a period of great difficulty, and perhaps that is why I enjoy sharing it with others so much. I am certified in hatha and aerial yoga, and also other practices such as pilates, barre and fitness dance. No matter the form they take, my classes are always oriented to help people find a sense of inner peace, balance and harmony - the attainment of which I believe to be the true purpose of yoga.
