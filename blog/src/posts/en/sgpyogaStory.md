**SGP Yoga** isn't just a yoga school. It is a tight-knit community of amazing people for whom yoga is more than just a practice - to us, it is a way of life. Each of us has their own unique story, and has experienced their own joruneys of healing & transformation. This gives us the capacity to provide top quality yoga education; we are not just instructors, but healers, teachers, and guides.

Our yoga school as you know it today didn't start with planning or ambition. Believe it or not, it arose spontaneously, when a few like-minded people, by pure chance, got together. At the beginning, they were just two of us - me *(Harjeet)* and *Camila*. I was giving kundalini yoga classes in *Mexico City*, while *Camila* was teaching aerial yoga. We both were excellent teachers, but we excelled in completely different categories. My area of expertise was yoga for healing & transformation and spiritual philosophy, while Camila was best at guiding students through advanced physical postures - she's an expert in body alignment. Moreover, she has a talent for community management and marketing, while I have technical knowledge in programming, video editing and graphic design. It didn't take us long to figure out that we complement each other - and we decided to join forces and see what we could achieve together.

We started by exchanging knowledge and organising joint workshops. We would attend each other's classes, share knowledge and experiences, and organize aerial yoga + sound healing sessions. The latter were very well received by the community, and this encouraged us to collaborate further. The breaking point came when Camila decided to organize an aerial yoga teacher training, and invited me to lead yoga theory sessions. Although we only had a few students, the training went exceptionally well, and we received warm feedback from the participants. In fact, little did we know that this was the beginning of something much bigger.

Our classes were growing in popularity, but we wanted to do other things as well. We started to think about organizing retreats and teacher trainings on a regular basis, not only in Mexico but also in other countries. We had substantial interest from our community, but one issue remained - if we started to travel to organise events, who would take care of our local community in the meantime? The answer came to us during the teacher training. We were very impressed by the level of some of the participants, and so when the time came, we invited them to lead some of our classes. This proved to be an excellent decision - the students were immediately happy with the new teachers, and we felt confident about travelling, knowing that our community was in good hands.

We quickly set out on a trip to Colombia and organized a retreat and a teacher training there, as well as a few shorter workshops. It wasn't always easy, but through hard work and determination, we made it work. At this point, we realized - dang, it's actually happening. We have a community of students, a team of amazing teachers - we just need to formalize it all into a business. And that's what we did. We set up a website, opened a company in Mexico, and started to coordinate our efforts as a team. At the moment of writing this article, the only thing that's really left is to find a space of our own - but for now, we are content to rent other places and host our sessions there.

We are excited to see what the future holds for us. The whole experience was unexpected - both me and Camila have spent years teaching yoga, and we know how difficult it is to make a living from it, yet alone open your own school. We are eternally grateful for the support you have all given us - and we assure you, we have big plans for the future.

Thank you for being on this journey with us.

With Love,
