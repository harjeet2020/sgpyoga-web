## **Introduction**

There are hundreds, if not thousands of articles about chakras scattered throughout the web. And yet, despite reading through a large number of them, I still haven’t found one that I could deem sufficiently exhaustive. That is why I have decided to write one myself – distilling years of experience as a kundalini yoga teacher and practitioner into a single article that, hopefully, will deepen your understanding of how chakras work and how it is relevant not only to our practice, but to the way we experience life. Besides the chakras themselves, we will discuss what happens when one falls out of balance – as you will discover, a chakra can spin too slowly or too quickly, resulting in completely different types of disharmonies. We will also briefly cover the nature of energy itself – without understanding that, any discussion about chakras is ultimately meaningless.

Before we begin, it is important to understand that human beings are not merely flesh and bone. The entire universe is made up of energy – energy that we cannot see, but that, with certain training, we can feel. This energy is life itself; you can think of it as the true essence of all form. All thoughts are energy, all emotions are energy, all experiences are energy, and finally, every single living being - or even apparently dead object - is energy. This energy comes from *nowhere* – in spirituality, we tend to call this nowhere *consciousness*, *the source* or *God*. I call it *nowhere* here because that is essentially what consciousness is – empty space, a nothingness in which all things come to being, exist for some time, and then die. The big plot twist of spirituality is when you realize that what you think you are – and all energy, incidentally – doesn’t exist; is merely an illusion of perception we call *maya*. What you actually are is that immortal nothingness that is beyond the concept of existence – and it is in this nothingness that we can say that *we are one.*

But let’s not stray too far from our topic. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that energy is real. *So, how is it possible?* – you might ask. *How every thought, emotion, living being, and object can be made up of the same energy?* It is a question of density.

At its purest, energy could be defined as a state of consciousness. While consciousness doesn’t have any qualities that we could describe and is unchangeable, energy is something tangible that can have varying characteristics. A profound sense of peace, for example, feels very different from joy – but both are similar in nature, two aspects of the divine manifested as a sensation. Energy is a vibration, and depending on the frequency of this vibration it can represent a myriad of different things. And, energy can have density.

A higher state of consciousness would be energy of very low density. However, as we human beings dwell in that state of consciousness, we begin to create thoughts that correspond to it, trying to further explore its nature. Those thoughts form images, and we begin to experience feelings – emotions - related to what we imagine. And if we keep dwelling in this state of consciousness for a long time, thinking and feeling, eventually it will condense into matter, creating a reality that we can experience through our senses. This is how the universe was created – *is* being created. Not by a god sitting on a throne in the heavens – but by consciousness that stands behind every living being.

The implications of this are enormous. Rather than being victims of circumstance or fate, we realize that we are creator beings – not only capable of creating the image of our life, but fully and solely responsible for it. So, if we have such an amazing power of creation, why do our lives often look so miserable? The truth is a little bit sad. What we currently are is a sorry excuse for humanity, a mere shadow of what it was intended to be. Somehow, we managed to forget who we are, and were tricked by our own minds into thinking that we are something much lesser. We lost many of our inherent abilities, and started to act in an insane manner, subconsciously trying to destroy our own selves by resisting that what is. I do not have to explain, I hope, that we *are* that what is, so trying to resist that what is is similar to punching yourself in the face – only much, much worse. This is the fall of consciousness, the mythical banishment from the Garden of Eden. No angry god banished us from paradise as punishment, however – rather, a part of our psyche split, suddenly deciding to destroy the other part, perceiving it as a threat. It is pure madness – and it is in pure madness that we live to this day, calling this state of things “normal”. Personally, I find this notion quite frightening.

Fortunately, there is hope. If you were as mad as others, you wouldn’t be reading this article, or you would immediately condemn it as nonsense. More and more people begin to question, to ponder, and ultimately end up discovering the true nature of things – to a larger or lesser extent. This is called *the awakening of consciousness* – consciousness becoming aware of itself - and it is happening now on a very large scale. It is a process that is not instantaneous, however; in fact, it can be really difficult if you don’t have proper guidance and don’t know what you’re doing. That is what we have all this knowledge for – it greatly accelerates our evolution, helping us free ourselves from our minds, and thus step out of suffering, faster.

The reason knowledge about energy – and chakras – is so helpful, is that it shows us exactly what we need to work with in order to advance. Each human being has a complex system of energy that overlays the physical body, and inscribed in that energy system there are many thoughts and emotions that we are unconscious of. Those unconscious thoughts and emotions constitute our *karma;* they are a record of past experiences (including those from our previous lives) that were particularly difficult for us to digest. Remember how I told you that our thoughts and emotions have the power to create our reality? Well, those thoughts that we haven’t managed to let go of completely, they continue to create experiences in our lives; experiences that we perceive as painful and undesirable due to past trauma. To be able to create the image of life we desire, first we need to get all this subconscious pain out of the way. To do so, we must bring those unconscious thoughts to the light of our consciousness – in other words, we must face this pain again, overcome it, and release it. At times this process can be extremely difficult to bear – although it kind of happens automatically, without conscious action on our part. The problem is, subconsciously we go out of our way to keep running from our trauma – and the longer we run, the more it builds up within us, resulting in more and more dramatic experiences arising in our perception – all to make us *see*. Practicing kundalini yoga, we can make the entire process much smoother and easier. When we do a *kriya* – a kundalini yoga sequence - we move dormant energy within our bodies, reconnecting to our energy system and extracting *karma* inscribed within it. From a more practical perspective, *karma* is like a blockage in our energy system. The more blocked our system is, the less we are who we really are, and the more we identify with what we are not. Or put even simpler, the more blockage within us, the heavier and more miserable we feel; the more we release this blockage, the lighter we get, gradually attaining a sense of inner peace and harmony. When beginning their spiritual journey, many people are unable to feel their energy system at all, their entire attention consumed by their thinking process. As you practice more, this knowledge becomes a part of your experience; you gain the ability to feel and even manipulate energy. It is also possible to feel particular energy centers, examine their current state, and even sense whether and what kind of *karma* is being released at the moment. This in turn allows us to pick a specific spiritual practice that can help us, resulting in a much smoother, faster, and less painful release.

I realize that it was perhaps a lengthy introduction, but if you didn’t have this knowledge, you wouldn’t be able to benefit in any way from the information that follows. Many people know about chakras, even meditate with them, but are unable to use what they know to facilitate their spiritual transformation. In fact, a large number of people – spiritual/yoga teachers included - remains in stagnation for years, talking about spirituality but still running away from their trauma just like everyone else. They recite meaningless affirmations, attend festivals and workshops, do yoga and chant mantras – but ultimately, all this is in vain if one fails to look at what resides within them, sincerely and with utmost honesty. Even I continually find myself surprised by the depth of my ignorance and stupidity – and by my inclination to ignore what I don’t want to see. Over the years I’ve learned that this awareness of our shortcomings is a very good thing. It means that we’re still growing. It is the things we don’t notice that usually hold us back; everything else is already being transformed by the light of our awareness. In other words, the mere act of noticing your trauma brings about healing. I can also say from experience that truly following the spiritual path requires immense dedication and courage – and pain, so much pain that you are rendered unable to continue living in a lie. This path is not chosen by us – it is forced upon us whether we want it or not, and we can do nothing to prevent, accelerate or decelerate it. And yet, although certainly difficult and painful, it is a glorious path to follow – for along the way, you get to experience and discover things unimaginable. An entire new world opens up to you; and although the journey is much more important than the destination, what awaits us at the end is not bad either – at the end, there lies true freedom.

## **The Human Energy System**

Now that you are aware of all this, let us return to more practical matters and see what we know about our energy system – and how to put this knowledge to a good use.

The human energy system consists of energy channels called *nadis.* According to ancient yogic texts, there are 72,000 of them (some traditions say 144,000, counting the channels on the left and the right side of the body separately). Fresh energy enters our system as we inhale, while used up, polluted energy is removed as we exhale. Incidentally, that is why we put such an emphasis on the breath in yoga and meditation – as you will discover or might have already, with our breathing not only can we regulate the functioning of our entire organism, but also consciously manipulate energy - keeping in check our thoughts and emotions, and even affecting the flow of life experience to our advantage. Breath is the bridge between energy and consciousness, life and the space in which it exists. Thus, meditating on the flow of the breath is one of the oldest and simplest meditation techniques – technically, the only technique you really need. But back to the point.

The largest and most important *nadis* in the body is called *the sushumna,* and it flows along the spine from its base up to the top of the head. There are also many *chakras* – points in the system where energy congregates, forming spinning vortices. Those vortices facilitate the movement of energy, keeping it coursing smoothly through the system. There are a great many chakras – hundreds, perhaps thousands of them - but we usually distinguish the seven major ones. All of those are located along the *sushumna*, and all the dysfunctional mental-emotional patterns can eventually be traced to an imbalance in one of them. There is more depth to it, of course – blockages can be found in different places in the body, not only the main seven chakras – but since each major chakra affects a big area of our energy network, and yoga exercises work on the entire body, it is useful to talk about imbalances in those terms. For example, if we have trouble with anger, it is likely because our third chakra – *manipura* – is spinning too fast. We can then do a *kriya* that focuses on this chakra, and with regular practice our anger will fade as the chakra falls into balance.

The more sensitive we get to our energy system, the easier it is to feel such things and choose appropriate *kriyas* to practice. Beginner yogis usually just do things they like – but when you get to a certain level, you begin to use the tools that yoga offers to consciously facilitate your spiritual evolution. That is why kundalini yoga is said to be THE yoga for self-transformation - no other style can offer such benefits, although each certainly has its own forte. Because the physical body and the energy system are largely interrelated, practicing yoga can also be helpful in healing physical ailments or diseases. That being said, we must remain cautious – in some cases, a reckless yoga practice might hurt us rather than help, particularly in face of a medical condition.

If you are getting a little impatient with the pace of this article, don’t worry – we’ll get to the seven major chakras soon. However, there is one more crucial thing we should examine before we continue. I mentioned at the very beginning that a chakra can spin too fast or too slow, resulting in different types of disharmonies. This is a detail that most people overlook; a detail, or lack thereof, that makes most articles about chakras shallow and incomplete. For example, many articles state that people with blocked heart center (4th chakra, *anahata*), are often lonely and self-centered. But few mention that being overly selfless and nice also signifies an imbalance of the very same chakra. Lack of proper explanation confuses people – how can two apparently opposite issues indicate the same thing (a chakra out of balance)? Knowing that a chakra can spin too fast or too slow eliminates the confusion – in this case, you can clearly see that being self-centered is a sign of a blocked heart center (chakra spinning too slow), while being overly selfless signifies that the chakra is overactive (i.e. spinning too fast). Now you won’t fall into the trap of thinking *“I am such a nice and selfless person, so I don’t need to work on my heart center”.* You will also understand that living a spiritual life doesn’t mean that you must be nice to people all the time – in some situations, you will find that it is required from you to be harsh and to the point.

So, what implications does this distinction have? Fortunately, from the yogic perspective things do not change much – a practice that focuses on the heart center will help keep the heart chakra in balance, regardless of whether it is spinning too slow or too fast. But being aware of the distinction lets us understand our energy system much better. It is one thing to read about chakras and another to actually notice and understand the disharmonies that occur in our energy system. Furthermore, an overactive upper triangle (the upper three chakras) often signifies that we should work more on the lower triangle – and vice versa. After all, chakras don’t work in isolation, but as an interconnected system where each element depends on the others. That being said, don’t worry too much about the intricate details – basic knowledge about chakras is enough to get you going; your intuition will take care of the rest, guiding you in your practice.

And one last thing – while working with chakras, we are not merely trying to keep them in balance. As we progress, we significantly strengthen each chakra, developing qualities that make us better human beings. Heart center, for example, is associated with empathy, humility and gratefulness. Consider people such as Dalai Lama or Nelson Mandela – merely thinking of them brings about a vague sense of those qualities. As we get further on the spiritual path, we begin to exhibit such qualities as well, if to a smaller degree initially. In a way, those qualities are what we truly are, and our delusional mind is the only thing that separates us from them. All you need to do is to let go of all resistance, surrendering your entire self to the present moment – discovering that you *are* the present moment. To die before you die, and discover that there is no death. I know, sounds pretty complicated, especially that last bit. In reality, it’s incredibly simple – it is only the human mind that perceives it as unintelligible nonsense. Fortunately, we are more than just the mind; even though there are things that it cannot understand, we can *comprehend* those things without it – with the power of our *awareness*.

What follows is a detailed description of each of the seven major chakras. Treat it more as a guide than a set of strict facts; if you use it well, it should help you reconnect with your own energy system, which in turn will help you develop a more effective yoga/spiritual practice.

> To master root chakra is to drink from an empty cup, and be sated.
> 

**The Root Chakra** represents all aspects of our material existence. It is responsible for health and wellbeing of our form – the physical body – ensuring it gets all it needs. It is associated with feelings of belonging and security, and is most commonly blocked by fear or worry for survival. It also represents our connection to **Mother Earth** and all life.

<div class="text-blue">

If your root chakra is balanced, you are grounded and stable. You know that you can provide for yourself, and do not easily succumb to fear or anxiety. You realize that life at its core is simple, and you don't need much to be happy. You feel like you belong where you are, and are content with what you have.

</div>

<div class="text-gray">

If your root chakra is blocked (spinning too slow), you are disconnected from the reality of things. You worry too much, and your thoughts and actions are chaotic. You tend to overcomplicate things, and often feel apart from others, lonely and misunderstood. You fear change and the challenges it brings, and your desire for stability and safety prevents you from truly enjoying life.

</div>

<div class="text-orange">

If your root chakra is overactive (spinning too fast), you are overly focused on the material aspects of life. Your main goal is to accumulate wealth, and you don't hesitate to do this at the expense of others. You are arrogant and egocentric, unaware of the reality beyond the tip of your nose. More subtle aspects of life escape you.

</div>

<div class="text-green">

If you have mastered your root chakra, you have transcended fear completely. You put your trust in a higher power, and fearlessly stride into the most difficult of situations, reliably providing solace and stability to those around you. The concepts of scarcity, poverty and limitation don't exist for you - for you understand that you are the very substance of all form.

> 

**The Sacral Chakra** is the gravity center of the human body, where the majority of our inner power resides. It is the source of sexual energy - the very energy of creation. It represents the fluidity and joy of life, a sense of inner freedom, feelings, subtelty and sensuality.

<div class="text-blue">

If your sacral chakra is balanced, you walk though life gracefully, truly enjoying every little moment. You are sensitive, creative, and simply go with the flow. Everything seems vibrant to you, and you have an inherent sense of joy and happiness that never fades.

</div>

<div class="text-orange">

If your sacral chakra is overactive (spinning too fast), you are overwhelmed by the intensity of your feelings and sensations. You are erratic and impulsive, acting first and thinking second, then suffering for it. Your emotions drown out logic, and you are prone to mood swings and addictions. You are a prisoner of your pleasures and desires, loosing your balance and wellbeing in favour of temporary satisfaction.

</div>

<div class="text-green">

If you have mastered your sacral chakra, you have learned to live on a knife's edge. You are filled to the brim with potent energy of pure joy and ecstasy, and yet you have complete control over it.

<div class="text-gray">

If your solar plexus chakra is blocked (spinning too slow), you lack mental discipline to achieve anything. You think success is impossible, and you give up on your projects whenever you encounter difficulties. You are easily influenced by others, and struggle to form your own opinions. You often feel inferior and worthless.

</div>

<div class="text-orange">

If your solar plexus chakra is overactive (spinning too fast), you let your strength sabotage your life, and that of others. You have a forcefull personality, dominating others with your presence and not letting them express themselves. You bend people to your will, sometimes even manipulating them to achieve your goals. You'd do anything to get what you want, and when you fail anyway, you get angry - furious, even. When met with difficulties, you keep banging your head against the wall, until the wall (or your head) finally breaks.

</div>

<div class="text-green">

If you have mastered your solar plexus chakra, your will becomes reality. You do not have to fight or struggle to achieve your goals - you simply do things, and they work. You radiate unparalleled strength, discipline and focus - and you use those qualities to live a peaceful and harmonious life.

<div class="text-orange">

If your throat chakra is overactive (spinning too fast), you are a compulsive liar. You use words to paint illusions that have little to do with reality.

### 7th Chakra: Sahasrara

<aside>

<div class="aside-text">

**Name:** Crown Chakra

**Sanskrit Name:** Sahasrara

**Color:** White

**Element:** Thought

**Food:** Fasting

**Verb:** I know

**Force:** Consciousness, Wisdom

**Challenge:** Numbness

**Location:** The Top of the Head

</div>

<img src="/assets/graphics/chakras/7.png" alt="Sahasrara - Crown Chakra" class="aside-photo">

</aside>

> Pain is the price we pay for wisdom.
> 

**The Crown Charka** represents our connection with the divine. It is consciousness in its purest form - nothingness. It is associated with our ability to accept & let go, surrendering to a will higher than ours. It gives us wisdom, spiritual understanding, and a sense of inner freedom.

<div class="text-blue">

If your crown chakra is balanced, you are living a spiritual life in a material world. You are aware of your existance as a soul, and you let the power of your spirit sustain you and express itself in form. You don't identify yourself with your body or mind, and recognize that your life is but a brief stop on a millenial journey. You know when to push and when to let go, balancing constructive action with the philosophy of surrender.

</div>

<div class="text-gray">

If your crown chakra is blocked (spinning too slow), spiritual knowledge eludes you. You only see the surface of the ocean of life, and you remain ignorant of its true depth. You strongly identify yourself with your body and mind, and you find it difficult to accept & let go. Your spritiual growth is extremely slow due to your reluctance or inability to self-reflect. You are immature and childish, and you tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again, mulishly refusing to learn.

</div>

<div class="text-orange">

If your crown chakra is overactive (spinning too fast), you are overly detatched from the world.  Your acceptance of what is has become a form of apathy, and your wisdom has turned into spiritual arrogance. You secretly hate yourself and your life, and you feel a prisoner and a victim of the reality that surrounds you. You are lonely and unhappy, and feel powerless, unable to effect a meaningful change in your life, not caring enough to try.

If you have mastered your crown chakra, you are in this world, but not of it. You dwell in higher states of consciousness, and nothing that happens in your material life has the capacity to take this inner kingdom away from you. You have transcended suffering, and this has brought you to a permanent state of inner freedom. You are one with all life, and you see space & time not as constraints, but merely expressions of infinity in form.
