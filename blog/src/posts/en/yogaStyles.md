## Choosing A Yoga Style

If you have just began exploring the world of yoga, you might be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of different yoga styles that are practiced these days. You might wonder, *how on earth am I supposed to know which style is the right one for me?* Trust me, we have all been there. But you don't need to choose alone. In this article, we will compare the most popular styles to help you make an informed decision. You might not know it yet, but choosing a yoga style has an enormous impact on your yoga journey. Still, I would encourage you to simply try out a few different styles and choose the one that resonates with you the most. And if you've been practicing for a while, it's always worth to try something different every now and then.

## Where Do Yoga Styles Come From?

Before we begin our comparison, let's take a look on what a yoga style actually is. The philosophical purpose of all styles is the same - to reconnect with the divine that resides within. However, each style has a different idea of how to achieve this. Some styles have evolved to push the physical body to its limits, while others are incredibly spiritual and meditative. While certain styles claim to follow a pure lineage of tradition, no yoga style is truly the same today as it was at its origins. Yoga kept evolving over time, adjusting to the demands of the modern world - and this is how we arrived at the practices that we have today. Much knowledge was lost over time, yes, but the core principles remain the same. And to be fair, the particular tradition that you follow is becoming less and less important. This knowledge doesn't come from books anyway - it comes from the universal consciousness each of us can access through their heart.

## Yoga Styles Comparison

### Popular Yoga Styles

These are the most popular and well-known yoga styles as of today. Their focus is mostly on the physical body, but they often include some spiritual elements as well.

#### Hatha Yoga
Hatha yoga is the traditional foundation of most yoga styles. It is a slower-paced practice that focuses on physical postures and breathing techniques. It is a great introduction to yoga, as it helps you develop a strong foundation. Hatha yoga also has strong spiritual roots; it relies on the concepts of mindfulness and mental discipline, balancing excertion and relaxation to cultivate stability and inner peace.

#### Vinyasa Yoga
Vinyasa yoga is a dynamic practice that emphasises the flow from one yoga pose to the next. It works great to improve circulation and flexibility; over time, it helps you regain a sense of balance and agility. Vinyasa is a great style for those who struggle with sitting still and meditating; it is fast-paced, fluid and dynamic, engaging you in one posture after another with little to no room for rest.

#### Yin Yoga
Yin yoga is a slower-paced practice that focuses on holding yoga poses for an extended period of time. It is an excellent style for those seeking a soft, gentle, restorative practice focused on stretching and relaxation. The purpose of yin yoga is not to challenge the body, but to soothe away tensions and stiffness. Many fitness trainers and sportsmen practice yin yoga, since it works marvels at recovery from intense workouts.

#### Ashtanga Yoga
Ashtanga yoga is a style that follows a strict sequence of poses, which are performed in a specific order. It focuses on building strength and stamina, and is known for pushing the physical body to its limits. It is a great style for those who are looking for challenge, discipline and regularity.

### Spiritual Yoga Styles

While most modern yoga styles focus mostly on movement, spiritual styles embrace the ancient idea of using yoga as a vehicle for healing and self-transformation. These practices often seem weird at first to newcomers, but with time they reveal their power to transform lives.

#### Kundalini Yoga
Kundalini Yoga is considered the most spiritual yoga style out there. Besides physical excercise it incorporates meditation, advanced breathing techniques, and mantra chanting. Kundalini practices are designed to work with energy to achieve specific effects; advanced practitioners know to choose the practices that best suit their needs. Kundalini's spiritual focus doesn't mean that it's not physical though - while some practices are indeed quiet and meditative, others will challenge even yoga veterans. The strengths of kundalini are its depth and versatility - there are hundreds of different sequences to choose from, and each of them feels unique and has distinct purpose.

#### Jivamukti Yoga
It could be said that jivamukti yoga is a vigourous vinyasa practice, infused with mantra chanting and spiritual philosophy. While this might sound like a strange combination, jivamukti yoga is surprisingly fun and engaging, while maintaining a certain spiritual depth. It is not nearly as deep as kundalini - but vinyasa practitioners who want to add a spiritual dimension to their practice will find jivamukti yoga a great choice.

### Specialized Yoga Styles

#### Aerial Yoga
Aerial yoga takes traditional yoga sequences into the air, using silk hammocks suspended from the ceiling. Besides being both fun and spectacular, aerial yoga comes with some unique benefits. The silk hammock relieves pressure on the joints, making many advanced inverted postures accessible to absolute beginners.

#### Iyengar Yoga
Iyengar yoga utilizes props (such as blocks, straps and bolsters) to refine the alignment of each pose and make advanced postures more accessible. It is known for its precision approach and therapeutic benefits. It is a great choice for those looking for a structured, methodical approach to yoga.

#### Hot / Bikram Yoga
Hot yoga, also known as Bikram yoga, is a style that is performed in a heated room. The heat makes the body sweat, helping detoxify the body and improve circulation. While it remains a niche practice, it is an interesting alternative for those looking for a different yoga experience.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this overview will help you make an informed decision. There are many more niche yoga styles out there that we haven't covered, but these are the major ones. Remember, no style is better than the other - they are all different, and you should simply choose the one you feel you resonate with and need the most. And don't be afraid to experiment - practicing something else from time to time can bring a new depth to your practice.
