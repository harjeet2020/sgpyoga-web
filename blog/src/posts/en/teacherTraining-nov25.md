Dear Family,

There is nothing more rewarding for a teacher than to see their students take up the teacher´s mantle as well. That is why we are incredibly excited to be organizing this 50-Hour Aerial Yoga programme in Colombia. This opportunity is designed primarily for yoga teachers who would like to expand their repertoire, but is also open to students with no prior yoga certification.

The training will take place at **La Yoguitería** in *Calarca, Quindío*, from November 8 to December 14, 2025. The programme will span 5 full weekends (Saturdays & Sundays), and is designed to be taken in-person - but it is possible to take some modules online. However, participation is at least 2 full weekends is required to receive the Yoga Alliance certification. This format is designed to ensure a high training standard, but also provide the flexibility needed by those who live far from the training location.

Besides the physical and technical aspects of aerial yoga, we will also cover the fundamentals of yogic philosophy, breathwork, meditation, and the science of mantra and sound healing. Camila will lead the core aerial yoga sessions, while I (Harjeet) will be taking care of the theoretical modules.

If this sounds interesting to you, let us know as soon as possible - the number of spots is limited. Looking forward to working with you!

With Love,

Harjeet & Cami
